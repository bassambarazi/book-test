The [UBCO calendar description](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/courses.cfm?code=PHYS) of this course is: 

> Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization is an interactive tutorial primarily designed for learners with an interest in sequential decision analytics and problems. Sequential decisions under uncertainty are ever present and often ecountered in many fields, industries, organizations, and applications, perhaps too many to catalogue. The generality of sequential decision-making and its broad application across many varied and complex fields is not widely recognized. In no small part, this due to the diversity of sequential decision problems investigated by different communities and their applications. The independent developement of methods and solutions to sequential decision problems by specialized research and industry communities insinuates a lack of commonality between the seemingly different models and techniques.
